function [t, t_empty, elecmatrix, proj_elec_filename] = ccep_write_coordinates_1(dataRootPath, subj, ses)

%   This function part of writing the electrodes to the electrodes.tsv file
%   It load the electrodes.tsv file and a GIU to select the electrodes positions matrix. 
%   It prints the table and elecmatrix on purpose, because these have to be
%   set manually in the next step.
